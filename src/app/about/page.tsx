            My journey into tech was driven by six years as a Project Engineer
            on large-scale construction sites. That experience taught me
            firsthand the importance of reliable systems and the frustration of
            using tools that don&#39;t meet real-world needs. It&#39;s what
            drives me to build software that is not just technically elegant,
            but also robust and practical. To me, a strong foundation in
            algorithms is key to great system design, so I continue to sharpen
            my problem-solving skills on{" "}
